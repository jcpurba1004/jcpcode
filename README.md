# Welcome to My personal Repo
My name is Jeremiah Purba and I'm a part time student at San Diego Mesa College. In the future, I would like to work as a software engineer using machine learning and AI knowledge. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiah-purba-a429462a7/) 

I put my codes from all of programming courses that I took, such as:
* Python Programming (CISC 179)
  
  In this course, I learn the following:
  * Data types, variables, and expressions
  * Loops and selection statements 
  * String and Text File
  * List, Tuples and Dictionary
  * Function
  * GUI
    
* Programming Database Python (COMP 662)
  
  In this course, I learn the following:
  * Deep operations for Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) of database, in this case SQLite, using Python.
  * SQL Injections and ORM concepts
  * Use Python to visualize database by using Matplotlib, NumPy, and Pyplot
  * Access Database using Basic Web Framework such as Python Flask
  * Database Analysis using Python
